I had a 1967 Impala 4 door that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick.\n","Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA''',\n","        'answer':\"NTA.

He moved in with us and brought his twin daughters (Olivia & Sloane18) with him a couple of months ago. His sister (my wife) and I have one daughter (Zoey 16) and she and her cousins aren't close but get along fine.\n","Olivia & Sloane have no respect for Zoey's privacy, none. they used to walk into her room and take everything they get their hands on. Makeup, phone accessories, clothes, school laptop etc. Zoey complained a lot and I've already asked the girls to respect Zoey's privacy and stop taking things. My wife and Sammy saw no issue with this. After all, they're girls and this's typical teenage girls behavior. I completely disagreed.\n","Last straw was when Zoey bought a 60$ m.a.c makeup-kit that looks like a paintset that she saved up for over a month and one of the girls, Sloane took it without permission and ruined it by mixing shades together while using it. Don't know much about makeup but that's what Zoey said when she found the kit on her bed, and was crying. I told my wife and she said she'd ask Sloane to apologize but I got Zoey a lock after I found she was moving valuable belongings out the house because of this incidence!!!\n","Sammy and his daughters saw the lock and weren't happy, the girls were extremely upset. Sammy asked about it and I straight up told him. He said \"my daughters aren't thieves!!! it's normal that girls of the same age borrow each others stuff\" he said Zoey could easily get another makeup kit for 15 bucks from walmart and shouldn't even be buying expensive - adult makeup in the first place and suggested my wife take care of this \"defect\" in Zoey's personality trying to appear older than she is. He accused me of being overprotective and babying Zoey with this level of enablement.\n","I told him this's between me and my wife but she shamed me for putting a lock on Zoey's door for her cousins to see and preventing them from \"spending time\" with her saying I was supposed to treat them like daughters, then demanded I remove it but I said this lock does not get removed til her brother and his daughters are out of our house.\n","She got mad I was implying we kick them out and said her family'll hate me for this. so I reminded her that I let Sammy and his family move in which's something her OWN family refused to do so she should start with shaming/blaming them for not taking their own son and nieces/granddaughters in. if it wasn't for her family's unwillingness to help we wouldn't be dealing with this much disturbance at home.\n","Everyone's been giving me and Zoey silent treatment and my wife is very much upset over this.\n","''',\n","            \"answer\": '''\n","NTA.

They had two boys together (7 and 6) and I have made my peace with the fact that she will always love him. She even has a sort of shrine to him in our home and I would never ask her to remove it.\n","We got married only a couple of years ago and last Thanksgiving she asked me to come with her to Thanksgiving at her former in-laws house. Apparently she's gone to their house for Thanksgiving since her first husband died. I support this as it's a way for her to stay connected to her first husband's family and also since it's a way for her two kids to maintain a relationship with their father's side of the family.\n","So, I went last year. It was a little uncomfortable, but her late husband's family treated me really well. They were very kind and welcoming to me. It wasn't a bad Thanksgiving, but it was still really awkward and I felt very out of place.\n","This year my wife is trying to get me to go back, but I just want to go have Thanksgiving with my own family.

She's responded that we can have Christmas, Easter, the Fourth of July, etc with either her family or my family but that she's pledged Thanksgiving to her late husband's family and that I should come with her as her husband to support her.

We’ve been close throughout the years and have been at milestone events for each other. Mary just had a baby and is completely fitting the crazy new mother stereotype.\n","In college, Mary has always been someone who had to make it known that she was unique/different from the rest of us which wasn’t as draining then as it has become now. For starters, all other women in our circle, got married between the ages of 22-27 and we all have multiple kids. So the 5 of us were able to experience those milestones alongside one another and got closer as we shared similar lifestyles.\n","Mary was very adamant on not settling until her 30s because she wanted to travel and have different experiences which we all supported. Regardless, she would continue to make comments about how she’s so lucky unlike us because we’re “tied down with husbands and babies”. I think this is where she grew resentment towards us because we were in different places in life and she was upset we couldn’t have our group be similar to how it was in college.\n","Then into our mid 30s it became a whole saga of she’s getting older and can’t find a husband because all the “good men” are married or divorced with kids. When she finally got married, many could not attend because it was a destination event and child-free during Covid. This caused a fight because she said how she was there for us during our weddings but we couldn’t put aside a week for her. We had all told her how we wished we could, but it simply was not financially feasible and didn’t logistically work with our kids. But she just refused to hear us out and was simply so inconsiderate about our lives and families, saying we were horrible friends.\n","Now, Mary just gave birth to her first child and I was very excited for her. The only issue is that she moved from our state to a very remote place that’s only accessible by a 6hr car ride. Her baby is 6mo old and none of us have been able to go up to visit her. I think she’s been having a wrong idea of what a “village” is and has essentially demanded in our groupchat that we come up for the holidays and help her out because she’s having a hard time adjusting to mom life. But this would entail we all take a week off, arrange childcare, figure out transportation, and book hotels during the holidays. It’s gotten to the point where she’s posting cryptic messages on Facebook bashing “fake friends” who won’t be there for her. As much as I wish I could, I cannot physically support her in the way she needs me to do in this stage of life. It would have been completely different if she still lived in our city and this was earlier in life when we had less commitments/priorities. So I told her this and that if she was hoping for this big village and constant support, she should have thought about that when planning out her life because we can’t all just pause our lives for her. So AITA?\n","''',\n","            \"answer\": '''\n","YTA for not attending the wedding. I agree that u can't take a week off, but you could have managed to attend the wedding.
